# LuaToExe

I wrote NJLBasic out of nostalgia, it can interpret sources from the 80s, 
it also has a modern syntax, a graphical mode. It has a very interesting 
interactive mode. It can create very quickly an executable containing all 
the files of an NJBasic application. This executable will be autonomous, 
it will include all the resources of the application.
3 versions are available
NJLBasicC: pure console
NJLBasicAC: for ANSI compatible consoles
NJLBasicW: graphical mode
