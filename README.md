# NJLBasic

I wrote NJLBasic out of nostalgia, it can interpret sources from the 80s, 
I created NJLBasic out of nostalgia, in order to bring back to life the programming languages ​​of the 80s. 
It is able to interpret sources from that era while integrating a modern syntax and an advanced graphical mode.

In graphical mode, NJLBasic supports the management of sprites and sounds, thus facilitating the creation of games. Its interactive mode is particularly interesting for testing and executing code in real time.

In addition, NJLBasic allows to quickly generate a standalone executable containing all the files and resources necessary for an NJBasic application, without external dependencies.

## Three versions are available:
 - NJLBasicC: pure console
 - NJLBasicAC: for ANSI compatible consoles
 - NJLBasicW: graphical mode 

## Dependencies
Compiled under LAZARUS with my lib [RuntimeResources](https://github.com/neuts-jl/RuntimeResources)
